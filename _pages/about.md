Dr Yiwen Xing is a data visualization researcher whose work bridges human-centered design and domain-driven complexity. She is currently a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the [Oxford e-Research Centre (OeRC)](https://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford, where she works on the design of interactive visualization and visual analytics systems to support sense-making and decision-making in complex, data-intensive domains.

She obtained her PhD in Computer Science from the [Department of Informatics, King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics), under the supervision of Dr Alfie Abdul-Rahman and Dr Rita Borgo. Her doctoral research focused on visualization design and evaluation studies, with an emphasis on collaborative, domain-driven design processes.

She holds an MSc in Data Science from [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) and a BSc in Statistics (major) and Applied Psychology (minor) from [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/). This interdisciplinary background provides a strong foundation in quantitative analysis, computational methods, and human-centered thinking.

Her research projects span digital humanities, bioinformatics, and public health, where she has designed interactive systems to support domain-specific data analysis. Her current research interests are expanding into AI interpretability and transparency, applying visual and human-centered approaches to improve understanding and responsible use of machine learning systems.
