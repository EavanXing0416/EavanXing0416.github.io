Yiwen Xing is a data visualization researcher whose work bridges human-centered design and domain-driven complexity. She is currently a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the [Oxford e-Research Centre (OeRC)](https://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford, where she works on the design of interactive visual analytics systems to support sense-making and decision-making in complex, data-intensive domains.

She obtained her PhD in Computer Science from the [Department of Informatics, King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics), under the supervision of Dr Alfie Abdul-Rahman and Dr Rita Borgo. Her doctoral research focused on visualization design and evaluation studies, with an emphasis on collaborative, domain-driven design processes. She holds an MSc in Data Science from [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) and a BSc in Statistics (major) and Applied Psychology (minor) from [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/). 

Her research projects span digital humanities, bioinformatics, and public health, where she has designed interactive systems to support domain-specific data analysis. Her research interests include **visualization and visual analytics**, **human–computer interaction**, and **data science**. Building on these foundations, her work is expanding into **AI interpretability and transparency**, where she applies visual and human-centered approaches to support understanding of machine learning systems.

She is particularly motivated by the belief that, even in an era increasingly shaped by automated and AI-driven decision-making, humans continue to play an irreplaceable role in complex decision processes. A key direction of her research is to explore how visualization can lower barriers for human participation, enabling users to more effectively engage with, interrogate, and intervene in machine-driven decisions. She views this human-centered integration of visualization and AI as a critical and enduring direction for future research.
