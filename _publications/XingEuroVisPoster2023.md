In this paper, we introduce a visualization prototype designed to assist domain experts in examining the dispersal of books from religious orders throughout Europe during the sixteenth century and beyond. The prototype is the result of a collaboration between visualization researchers and a historical book researcher, aiming to apply visualization techniques to address real-world domain challenges.
