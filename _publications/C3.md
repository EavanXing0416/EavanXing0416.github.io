Understanding the trade data of historical books is crucial for researchers investigating the distribution and provenance of Incunabula (books printed between 1450 and 1500). We incrementally developed BookTracker, a platform featuring multiple visualization and visual analytics applications to support these research efforts. This platform leverages data from the Material Evidence in Incunabula (MEI) database, which meticulously records detailed information on the provenance, ownership, and use of 15th-century printed books. This paper details the evolution of BookTracker’s design and development alongside domain experts, highlighting the reflections and lessons learned from its application in various research projects. We discuss this long-term collaborative visualization project, hoping to offer our experience as a case study for similar research in the future.
