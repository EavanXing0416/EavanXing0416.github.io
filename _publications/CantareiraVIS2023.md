Visualizing event timelines for collaborative text writing is instrumental for navigating and understanding this type of data, as the size and complexity of both text and timelines increase. They are often employed in applications such as code repositories and collaborative text editors. In this poster, we present a visualization approach to explore historical records from the writing of legislative texts, which were discussed and voted on by assemblies of representatives. Focusing on event timelines from text documents that involve multiple people and different topics, we allow for exploring the history of text changes and tracking the provenance of given text sections, while highlighting the connections between all elements involved.
