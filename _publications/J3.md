Visualizing event timelines for collaborative text writing is an important application for navigating and understanding such data, as time passes and the size and complexity of both text and timeline increase. They are often employed by applications such as code repositories and collaborative text editors. In this article, we present a visualization tool to explore historical records of writing of legislative texts, which were discussed and voted on by an assembly of representatives. Our visualization focuses on event timelines from text documents that involve multiple people and different topics, allowing for observation of different proposed versions of said text or tracking data provenance of given text sections, while highlighting the connections between all elements involved. We also describe the process of designing such a tool alongside domain experts, with three steps of evaluation being conducted to verify the effectiveness of our design.
